 a guy's out in his driveway working 
 something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood 
 are magnetically drawn to this activity  They just come wandering 
 out of the house like Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle  Just   
 you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, ""Honey, 
 I think Jim's working on something there "" So they run over to the guy  Now they don't actually 
 help the guy  No, they just want to hang around the area where 
 work is being done  That's what want to do  We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, 
 we want to ask him dumb questions  You know, ""What are you using, 
 the Philips head "" You we feel involved  That's why when they have construction sites, 
 they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just 
 to keep the men out  They cut little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on  
 But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences  
 Right over there  ""What are you using steel girders down there  Yeah, that'll It's only a matter

 distinguish one red dot from another  
 I couldn't afford anything  I have nothing  
 I haven't worked for a really long time  
 I mean look, I have 
 no clothes, look at what I'm wearing  
 It's just a little red At the This is for Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me  
 Oh I knew you cared for As you care for me  Which is why it 
 is very important that you never breathe 
 a word of this to anyone about the    
 you know  What, with Clarence Thomas 
 and Okay, okay, can I open it Yes of course go ahead  My guess is 
 you're going to like this very Oh  Is that Of course it's A cashmere sweater  Oh Georgie Just a little something for When I was a little girl in Panama, 
 a rich American came to our town and 
 he was wearing the softest most beautiful 
 sweater  I said to him, ""what do you 
 call this most beautiful fabric "", and 
 he said ""they call it cashmere""  I repeated 
 the words ""cashmere, cashmere""  I asked 
 if I could have it, and he said ""No  
 Get away from me "" Then he started walk 
 away  But I grabbed onto his leg screaming 
 for him to give me the sweater and he 
 dragged me through the street  And then 
 he kicked at me with the other foot 
 and threw some change at me  Oh, but 
 I didn't want the change Georgie  I 
 wanted the I had a feeling you would like it  No, 
 don't try it on now, try it on Wow, look at this  It feels so Take it off  You're going to ruin What's At the comedy I was in the men's room the other day 
 and they had the hand blower, instead 
 of the paper towels, you know this thing  
 I like the hand blower I have to say  
 It takes a little bit longer, but I 
 feel when you're in a room with a revolting 
 stench you want to spend as much time 
 as you The only stench is comming from Oh, wait a second, I believe we have 
 a heckler ladies and gentlemen  Hey 
 Dick I don't know what your problem 
 is  It's not my fault you're back on 
 the It's off the In the old days how do you think they 
 got the alcohol from town to I don't On the wagon  Don't you think they broke 
 into a couple of those bottles along 
 the You can't drink on a wagon it would 
 be too They had smooth trails  What about the 
 Cumberland What the hell do you know about I know enough not to get on In the boss' I'm going to get right to the point  
 It has come to my attention that you 
 and the cleaning woman have engaged 
 in sexual intercourse on the desk in 
 your office  Is that Who said She Was that wrong  Should I have not done 
 that  I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance 
 on this thing because if anyone had 
 said anything to me at all when I first 
 started here that that sort of thing 
 was frouned upon, you know, cause I've 
 worked in a lot of offices and I tell 
 you peope do that all the You're Well you didn't have to say it like 
 I want you out of here by the end of 
 the What about the whole Christmas spirit 
 thing  Any flexability Nah  Wait, wait, she wanted me to give 
 you He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face  
 George walks out of the office ""wearing"" In the hall of the You had sex on your desk with the cleaning 
 You never had sex in the office No  I once made out with someone but 
 that was Alright so you made out with Well that's not Kissing is Kissing is not Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next 
 to Dick's on Over What are you doing I'm taking the kid out to dinner to 
 chear him Hey Jerry when do you consider that 
 sex has taken I would say when the nipple makes its 
 first So, George told me that you left the 
 drink next to Dick's on Nice try  So guess who heckled me at 
 the club last Merry Oh my god that's Dick  It's Cape Hide, hide under the Ow, ow move Get off of I've got no Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree  He looks 
 down and notices them under the table  George holds out the sweater, 
 his hand Is that Of course it's What's At the comedy But in a way, I think I inadvertantly 
 turned this guy into an alcoholic  I 
 hate being around alcoholics because 
 they're either telling you how much 
 they love you or how much they hate 
 you  And those are the two statements 
 that scare me the most  But I think

 none of the are intelligible at this They are banging on the car, trying

 his first Cut back to the limo  The explanations are becoming more heated 
 and understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva

 And it's funny because my new radar 
 detector was on  I didn't hear a thing  
 Isn't that Yeah  That's A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR  WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS  But oddly, for 
 some reason I didn't hear a thing except

 They're men with jobs, Jerry  They wear 
 suits and ties  They're married, they 
 have I told you not to I need some water  I gotta get some

 what were the parakeet flew into the 
 mirror  Now that's The parakeet in the mirror  That's a 
 good one, Yeah, it's one of my What about you, George  Have you written 
 anything we might Well, possibly  
 I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina "" 
   Actually, it was off-off-Broadway  
 It was a comedy about a Mexican Oh, it was very funny  There was one 
 great scene with the chef - what was 
 his Oh, Pepe  Yeah, Pepe  And, uh, he was 
 making Oh, he actually cooked on the No, no, he mimed it  That's what was 
 so funny about So, what have you two come up Well, we've thought about this in a 
 variety of ways  But the basic idea 
 is I will play May Go I think I can sum up the show for you 
 with one word: What does that The show is about Well, it's not about No, it's about Well, maybe in philosophy  But, even 
 nothing is Not even 
 Is it with a What's the   Well, as I was saying, I would play 
 myself, and, as a comedian, living in 
 New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, 
 and an ex-girlfriend, which is all Yeah, but nothing happens on the show  
 You see, it's just like life  You know, 
 you eat, you go shopping, you read   
 You eat, you read, You go You read  You read on the Well, I don't know about the reading   
 We didn't discuss the All right, tell me, tell me about the 
 stories  What kind of Oh, no  No No stories  So, what is What'd you do I got up and came to There's a show  That's a How is that a Well, uh, maybe something happens on 
 the way to No, no, no  Nothing Well, something Well, why am I watching Because it's on Not Okay, uh, look, if you want to just 
 keep on doing the same old thing, then 
 maybe this idea is not for you  I, for 
 one, am not going to compromise my artistic 
 integrity  And I'll tell something else, this is the show and we're not going to change 
 it  How about this: I manage 
 a I don't even want to talk about it anymore  
 What were you thinking  What was going 
 on in your mind  Artistic integrity  
 Where, where did you come up with that  
 You're not artistic and you have no 
 integrity  You know you really need 
 some help  A regular psychiatrist couldn't 
 even help you  You need to go to like 
 Vienna or something  You know what I 
 mean  You need to get involved at the 
 University level  Like where Freud studied 
 and have all those people looking at 
 you and checking up on you  That's the 
 kind of help you need  Not the once 
 a week for eighty bucks  No  You need 
 a team  A team of psychiatrists working 
 round the clock thinking about you, 
 having conferences, observing you, like 
 the way they did with the Elephant Man  
 That's what I'm talking about because 
 that's the only way you're going to 
 get       I thought the woman was kind of 
 Hold it  I really want to be clear about 
 this  Are you talking about the woman 
 in the meeting  Is that the woman you're 
 talking Yeah, I thought I might give her a call  
 I, I don't meet that many women  I meet 
 like three women a year  I mean, we've 
 been introduced  She knows my IT'S COMPLETELY Why  Maybe she liked me  I, I mean she 
 was looking right at me  You know, I 
 think she was impressed  You know, we 
 had good eye contact the whole Oh, I forgot to call Wait a minute let me call No, no this is more She might be leaving to work any No, I got to warn him that I told Joe 
 Devola about his It's And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable 
 with him and you know I just blurted 
 out something about your Whoa, back up a Well, I didn't know that you didn't

 the following winter  And he passed away 10 years later to the 
 day  His last words to me were, Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a 
 million times - she mouths the words as Mr  Ross says them) ""Cherish 
 the cabin "" Not, uh, ""Take of your sister "" She's a paraplegic  But, ""Cherish the 
 cabin "" And I have   for 45 years  It's 
 often been a   sanctuary for Kinda like Superman's

 social We    we must go forward    not George, that's beautiful  Ever thought of running for Tia, did you see all the flowers in 
 that bathroom  It's like an English 
 garden in They're gardenias, I thought I smelled Yes, there are a few of those, It's almost Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain 
 speaking  Due to equipment problems 
 at the runway at Laguardia, we've instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK  We apologize 
 for any What'd he 
 say  What'd he Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside 
 to see if J+E are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer

 Kennedy  We've got 45 Let's go  Listen to the bell, Grossbard--

 a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of Oh, saffron  That sounds And today we're featuring wines from 
 the *Tuscany* They do that ""tink"" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back 
 to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the 
 unwashed in coach and he's in her Hi  Can I get to my You're just gonna have to But you just passed it  I'm sitting 
 right there next to that You're not supposed to get up during

 *double* the bonus Back in *coach* Elaine 
 returns to seat now that the attendant is done Excuse me  I'm sorry to make you do 
 this, but I got stuck in the aisle and 
 the flight attendant wouldn't let me 
 get There's no way to get around that PASSENGER You're not supposed to get up during 
 the food I'll try and remember that  
 Where's my PASSENGER He asked me where you were, and you 
 were gone so long I thought you, uh, 
 switched Uh-huh    Elaine addresses the nearby Excuse me  Excuse me, but I didn't get 
 a Are you Yes, I'm sure  I would know if a tray 
 of food had been served to Would Ooooh, them's fightin' words, Well, the only meal left is a kosher 
 Kosher meal  I don't want a kosher meal  
 I don't even know what a kosher meal 
 PASSENGER I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected 
 it, or PASSENGER No, no  It all has to do with the way 
 they kill the PASSENGER They don't eat PASSENGER They do if it's killed right-- under 
 a Rabbi's Ummmm, sure  Another passenger addresses the debate 
 from somewhere out of camera PASSENGER Oh, You know what  *I* ordered the kosher 
 Then why didn't you take PASSENGER I ordered it six weeks ago, I You're eating my Look, I got earplugs to collect  Do 
 you want it, or Take the food, Elaine  But ask that guy just what the heck a 
 kosher meal is-- I'm Meanwhile, Jerry and Tia enjoy a nummy-lookin' dessert This is the best sundae I've ever Oh, man  You know what    they got the 
 fudge on the bottom-- That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're 
 eatin' your ice I've never met a man who knew so much 
 about Thank We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end 
 of her More More Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered Back at Look, I got Super Savers  Super Savers  Are they You bought non-refundable tickets, you 
 She talked me in to it-- she said it 
 was the best Do you know how much this is going to 
 cost Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split 
 it with How big of you, you brute  They board the Look, I'm gonna go to the I dunno, George  Those *coach* bathrooms stink  Just ask Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard  For his part, Grossbard 
 doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago After trying 
 in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the 
 plane  Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom 
 door to a reply of ""Just a minute"" from the occupant inside Anyway, the door opens and, surprise  It's the 
 Prisoner without his Time magazine Anyway, 
 the guy pulls George into the bathroom So, while George is in 
 the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane  
 Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet  And what's up with 
 going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane  Isn't there laws 
 against that  Or is it just trains that you have to wait until 
 they're moving  Who really cares, Excuse me    Excuuuse What  Oh, no    nothing for me What is your Elaine You're going to have 
 to go back to No, but there was nobody sitting Yes, but you're still not allowed  These 
 seats are very Oh, no, please, don't send me back there  
 Please, I'll do anything  It's so nice 
 up here  It's so comfortable up here  
 I don't want to go back there  Please 
 don't send me back there    Do you realise that 
 the people up here are getting The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket 
 and napping What is going Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into 
 first Oh, you see, that's terrible  The problem 
 is, that curtain is no security-- there 
 really should be a locking Electrified, with a moat if possible  They return to Hey  That guy owes me 240 No good  He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly 
 Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances 
 out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms 
 flailing out on the runway  He takes a second look, just to be 
 Couldn't After they get off the plane, J+E look for the boys and get their 
 how would they know Kramer was there, 
 too  They didn't get a hold of George 
 on the phone, or he would've went to 
 Laguardia in the Where are they already  I don't see 
 them Well, George is being raped in a bathroom and Kramer is still 
 on the lam somewhere in the I got my bags, I'm ready to Yeah, *you* got *your* In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving 
 around the baggage thingy, complete with The worst flight I have been on in my 
 entire Yeah, me He seems so sincere  Tia walks by, along with an entourage of 
 I'll call Okay    It's 
 a business Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out-- 
 you didn't expect a whole episode to go by without a ""Kramer 
 entrance"", did You guys Yeah  Where's Well, you can't hear him through the window, but he is definitely 
 But I have to admit, I like flying  
 I like those little bathrooms that they 
 have on the plane  It's kind of like 
 a small apartment of your own on the 
 plane  You go in, you close the door, 
 the light comes on  It's like a small 
 surprise party every time you go in 
 there  The worst way of flying, I think 
 is ""standby"", you ever fly standby  
 It never works, you know, that's why 
 they call it you stand there going ""Bye "" So I was on this flight where the 
 flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't 
 have a uniform for her yet, and that really    makes a big I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going

 the Wow  You know what I would do if I was 
 running mayor  One of my campaign themes would be that everybody

 It would be like small Maybe I'll mention that to Really  You sure you don't want any No, I'm watching my Well, it's Yeah, so they Well, should we Yeah  Three days and he hasn't called me, 
 and you know Because he thinks I'm too He said No, but I saw the look on his face when 
 he put his around me  And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on

 one of his chairs and it broke  And he says, ""Boy, you're lot of Hey  So, hear anything on the No, but I expect to hear Well, I wouldn't get your hopes Why do you say No reason  Oh, did you hear about that 
 No  What about You didn't He's proposing a plan where everyone 
 in the city should name Name Yeah  So people can go around saying 
 ""hello"" to one Oh, I see  So you can go, ""Hey, you 
 know who I wilding today  He's become the laughing stock  You 
 know The Times already stated it could cost him the election  Name Hello  Yes  Uh-huh  Yeah  Oh, really  
 Okay, thank very much  Bye-bye  Well, the yogurt verdict is in  The next morning, I woke up, and it 
 was going like this  can control it if I really concentrate  But otherwise, Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly 
 honest with Please, I've examined I've looked at your And I find that there's absolutely nothing 
 wrong with Hmm  Really  Nothing that would indicate involuntary 
 Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't 
 No, not How May I suggest the possibility that you're 
 Faking  What makes you think that I 
 have time to doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's

 absolutely nothing wrong with me  What kind of a person

 would do a thing like I don't know what kind of a person would 
 do something that  Obviously a very sick person  A very immature A person who has no regard for wasting other people's

 valuable time  Now, see here, I said, Fine  Jerry, come on, look  Let's go over 
 to that yogurt Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about 
 this  This has got be a massive conspiracy  Who knows how deep it goes  Hey,

 look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical 
 last week, some startling news today when his cholesterol count out to be a whopping 375  What effect this will have on minds of the voters remains to be seen  In another

 development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag

 fiasco  We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Giuliani is about to make a It's hard to understand  Because I've 
 been doing everything normally do  I've been watching my diet very carefully  I

 exercise regularly  My only indulgence, I guess, would be I eat a lot of frozen yogurt  But it's Yogurt  Oh, my god  They got Giuliani 
 and he doesn't know Now look what you've Well, we've got to do something  I'm 
 calling Name tags  Name tags  What kind of an 
 idiot anybody would be interested in an idea like Dad I don't think it's so bad  People should wear name Everyone would be a lot friendlier  ""Hello, Sam "" ""How are

 you doing, Joe "" Hey, your arm  It moved again  I thought

 you said it went I banged it on the desk in the doctor's 
 office  And     Be quiet  They're starting the press 
 Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's sold throughout the city  I pledge to you now, that if I'm

 elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint special task force to investigate this matter  I promise my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do

 everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified The old yogurt was so much better  Oh, 
 this is Oh, it Mine, too  I got one more I can't eat Newman Hey, Jerry  Thanks a lot  I hope you're It had fat in it, it's not good for 
 Newman I don't care  It was good  I was enjoying it  Had interfere  Couldn't leave well enough alone  Well, I will even with you for this  You can count on Hey, you guys, listen to this  Listen 
 to this  some blood spilled into Mr  Giuliani's test tube causing cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was reported  Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched election for the Republican  It was the one issue which

 seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into So, in effect, the yogurt won him the 
 I wonder what actually happened in that 
 Yeah, me, Newman I can't eat Thanks for ruining my daddy's business,

 really thought she was going to collapse

 the constitution for it  That's why

 George, of course, of course it can 
 wait until march if that is what you 
 Oh, don't worry your head  Of All right  The prophet Isaah tells us without 
 friends our lives are empty and Wait  Whoa  That's the Rabbi: from Elaine's 
 building  I just met this guy the other 
 A young lady I know, let's call her 
 Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed 
 with feelings of resentment and hostility 
 for her friend, let's call him George:  
 She felt that George was somewhat of 
 a loser and that she was the one who 
 deserved to be married first  She also 
 happened to mention to me that her friend 
 had wondered if going to a prostitute 
 while you're engaged is considered cheating  
 His feeling was they're never going 
 to see each other again so what's the

right, let's go let's go  You're on stage in 25 The dating world is not a fun world   it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain   and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things  Women need equipment  I don't know what they need  I know I don't have it, I know that   Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls  This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me   I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story  I've never had one   I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself  ""I could use a cotton-ball right now""   I can certainly get out of this mess   Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags  They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies  What are you doin' with them  The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience    tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them   I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house  I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds  I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town  ""Let's move on""    The dating world is a world of pressure  Let's face it  a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night  The only difference between a date and a job-interview is  not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it   ya know  ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective  I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the Really  'Cause it's all in the All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is Ya know a hug  definitely Hug is definitely Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet That's so brutal, I hate Ya know how they do That's why, ya know, a shake is Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""  The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the I see, well, that's open to interpretation  Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the Guess Hey, LAURA AND Heeeey  It's good to see This is my friend Hi, how nice to meet Hi, how are This is Laura, I can't believe you're GEORGE AND Ooh yeah, the bags, sure  Oh, thank Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, Yes, the

swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking  I don't get it, OK  I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals  I am not getting it  Women, they're so subtle, their little   everything they do is subtle   men are not subtle, we are obvious  Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want  We want women, that's it    It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is  we want women  How do we get them  Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know  The next step after that we have no idea  This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites  These are the best ideas we've had so far   The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty  Have you seen men doing this  What is this  The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks

something about a cheque that, to a man, is not I don't know exactly what it is    I think to a man, a cheque is like a from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if contact these

heard this interior design principle that mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room  What kind of a walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in There's a guy in there looks just like me "" But the parakeet will fall this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG  With little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh  And I'd always

""they call it cashmere""  I repeated the words ""cashmere, cashmere""  I asked if I could have it, and he said ""No  Get away from me "" Then he started walk away  But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street  And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me  Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie  I

day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing  I like the hand blower I have to say  It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a

to the point  It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office  Is that Who said She Was that wrong  Should I have not done that  I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked

way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic  I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you  And those are the two statements that scare me the most  But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me  He's finally off the You mean on the Don't get THE"

described as 5'5"" bald and reputedly a very generous The thing about L A  to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert  Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is  I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes punched in the top  What the hell is going on out there  It's very strange, do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their

really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror  Now that's The parakeet in the mirror  That's a good one, Yeah, it's one of my What about you, George  Have you written anything we might Well, possibly  I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina ""   Actually, it was off-off-Broadway  It was a comedy about a Mexican Oh, it was very funny  There was one great scene with the chef - what was his Oh, Pepe  Yeah, Pepe  And, uh, he was making Oh, he actually cooked on the No, no, he mimed it  That's what was so funny about So, what have you two come up Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways  But the basic idea is I will play May Go I think I can sum up the show for you with one word  What does that The show is about Well, it's not about No, it's about Well, maybe in philosophy  But, even nothing is Mr  Dalrymple, your niece is on the I'll call Not even Is it with a What's the   Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all Yeah, but nothing happens on the show  You see, it's just like life  You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read   You eat, you read, You go You read  You read on the Well, I don't know about the reading   We didn't discuss the All right, tell me, tell me about the stories  What kind of Oh, no  No No stories  So, what is What'd you do I got up and came to There's a show  That's a How is that a Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to No, no, no  Nothing Well, something Well, why am I watching Because it's on Not Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you  I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity  And I'll tell something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it  How about this  I manage a I don't even want to talk about it anymore  What were you thinking  What was going on in your mind  Artistic integrity  Where, where did you come up with that  You're not artistic and you have no integrity  You know you really need some help  A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you  You need to go to like Vienna or something  You know what I mean  You need to get involved at the University level  Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you  That's the kind of help you need  Not the once a week for eighty bucks  No  You need a team  A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man  That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get       I thought the woman was kind of Hold it  I really want to be clear about this  Are you talking about the woman in the meeting  Is that the woman you're talking Yeah, I thought I might give her a call  I, I don't meet that many women  I meet like three women a year  I mean, we've been introduced  She knows my

She was going to champion the show  That's what I was bring her up there to tell you  And she liked Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is What, are you crazy  It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up Vommiting is not a deal breaker  If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of What happened to Devola came after What  Devola  See I told you this guy is crazy  I can't believe this  What Can I have a coffee      What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know  I gota new strap  And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit  Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head  It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola  And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your Boy,that is some Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life  Look at Wow, Newman's I got bad news for you buddy  Devola says you're Me, He doesn't like What does he want from me  I didn't do anything  See this is all Elaine's fault  She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist  He

and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their Oh my    that *is* Would you care for some Sounds lovely  May Why, It's a perfect fit  You must be They chortle to themselves and tink glasses Back in the My name is not mentioned in this It's Why don't these people listen to me  I don't Who's When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent  Then one he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks  He took the cash and disappears  Well, I try to find him, I to his girlfriend's house, even his family  Uh-uh  I never got the money back  He screwed me  And that's the guy-- John Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years No, I'm gonna turn around    I'm gonna get that No-no-no, Kramer  Kramer  Kramer  You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup  It's a binding social We    we must go forward    not George, that's beautiful  Ever thought of running for Tia, did you see all the flowers in that

problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK  We apologize for any What'd he say  What'd he Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia  George has been inside to see if J+E are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer in the Well, You're not gonna believe The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy  We've got 45 Let's go  Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for Kramer peels out  He's on a mission from We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of Oh, saffron  That sounds And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* They do that ""tink"" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed in coach and he's in her Hi  Can I get to my You're just gonna have to But you just passed it  I'm sitting right there next to that You're not supposed to get up during the food Well, nobody *told* me Look  This plane is *full*  I got a lot of people to Now please    You're just gonna have to Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the

the bonus Back in *coach* Elaine returns to seat now that the attendant is done Excuse me  I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get There's no way to get around that PASSENGER You're not supposed to get up during the food I'll try and remember that  Where's my PASSENGER He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched Uh-huh    Elaine addresses the nearby Excuse me  Excuse me, but I didn't get a Are you Yes, I'm sure  I would know if a tray of food had been served to Would Ooooh, them's fightin' words, Well, the only meal left is a kosher Kosher meal  I don't want a kosher meal  I don't even know what a kosher meal PASSENGER I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or PASSENGER No, no  It all has to do with the way they kill the PASSENGER They don't eat PASSENGER They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's Ummmm, sure  Another passenger addresses the debate from somewhere out of camera PASSENGER Oh, You know what  *I* ordered the kosher Then why didn't you take PASSENGER I ordered it six weeks ago, I You're eating my Look, I got earplugs to collect  Do you want it, or Take the food, Elaine  But ask that guy just what the heck a kosher meal is-- I'm Meanwhile, Jerry and Tia enjoy a nummy-lookin' dessert This is the best sundae I've ever Oh, man  You know what    they got the fudge on the bottom-- That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice I've never met a man who knew so much about Thank We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end of her More More Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered Back at Look, I got Super Savers  Super Savers  Are they You bought non-refundable tickets, you She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best Do you know how much this is going to cost Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with How big of you, you brute  They board the Look, I'm gonna go to the I dunno, George  Those *coach* bathrooms stink  Just ask Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard  For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane  Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of ""Just a minute"" from the occupant inside Anyway, the door opens and, surprise  It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane  Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet  And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane  Isn't there laws against that  Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving  Who really cares, Excuse me    Excuuuse What  Oh, no    nothing for me What is your Elaine You're going to have to go back to No, but there was nobody sitting Yes, but you're still not allowed  These seats are very Oh, no, please, don't send me back there  Please, I'll do anything  It's so nice up here  It's so comfortable up here  I don't want to go back there  Please don't send me back there

outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket and napping What is all the racket back there  You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up What is going Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first Oh, you see, that's terrible  The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking Electrified, with a moat if possible  They return to Hey  That guy owes me 240 No good  He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway  He takes a second look, just to be Couldn't After they get off the plane, J+E look for the boys and get their how would they know Kramer was there, too  They didn't get a hold of George on the phone, or he would've went to Laguardia in the Where are they already  I don't see them Well, George is being raped in a bathroom and Kramer is still on the lam somewhere in the I got my bags, I'm ready to Yeah, *you* got *your* In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving around the baggage thingy, complete with The worst flight I have been on in my entire Yeah, me He seems so sincere  Tia walks by, along with an entourage of I'll call Okay    It's a business Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out-- you didn't expect a whole episode to go by without a ""Kramer entrance"", did You guys Yeah  Where's Well, you can't hear him through the window, but he is definitely But I have to admit, I like flying  I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane  It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane  You go in, you close the door, the light comes on  It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there  The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"", you ever fly standby  It never works, you know, that's why they call it you stand there going ""Bye "" So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really    makes a big I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going ""Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up "" It's like, ""Who the Hell are THE"

Nothing that would indicate involuntary Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't No, not How May I suggest the possibility that you're Faking  What makes you think that I have time to doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when absolutely nothing wrong with me  What kind of a would do a thing like I don't know what kind of a person would do something that  Obviously a very sick person  A very immature A person who has no regard for wasting other valuable time  Now, see here, I said, Fine  Jerry, come on, look  Let's go over to that yogurt Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this  This has got be a massive conspiracy  Who knows how deep it goes  look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, some startling news today when his cholesterol count out to be a whopping 375  What effect this will have on minds of the voters remains to be seen  In development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name fiasco  We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Giuliani is about to make a It's hard to understand  Because I've been doing everything normally do  I've been watching my diet very carefully  exercise regularly  My only indulgence, I guess, would be I eat a lot of frozen yogurt  But it's Yogurt  Oh, my god  They got Giuliani and he doesn't know Now look what you've Well, we've got to do something  I'm calling Name tags  Name tags  What kind of an idiot anybody would be interested in an idea like Dad I don't think it's so bad  People should wear name Everyone would be a lot friendlier  ""Hello, Sam "" ""How you doing, Joe "" Hey, your arm  It moved again  I you said it went I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office  And     Be quiet  They're starting the press Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's sold throughout the city  I pledge to you now, that if elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint special task force to investigate this matter  I promise my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified The old yogurt was so much better  Oh, this is Oh, it Mine, too  I got one more I can't eat Newman Hey, Jerry  Thanks a lot  I hope you're It had fat in it, it's not good for Newman I don't care  It was good  I was enjoying it  Had interfere  Couldn't leave well enough alone  Well, I will even with you for this  You can count on Hey, you guys, listen to this  Listen to this  some blood spilled into Mr  Giuliani's test tube causing cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was reported  Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched election for the Republican  It was the one issue seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into So, in effect, the yogurt won him the I wonder what actually happened in that Yeah, me, Newman I can't eat Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat THE"

been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue  According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks  We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff  Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to Jerry     Well, it has nothing to do with Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner  I wouldn't worry about I like Julie  She's very Yeah, she's very That's great So did you enjoy your Yeah, A big salad  Very good  Actually it was too big  Ha ha ha oh,      because she handed you the bag  I could have handed you the bag  She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though,     Even though       naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh,       what's the What  What are you trying to say, It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad  She just happened to hand it to you  But it's no big You want the money for the big salad, No, What is the There is no problem      just a small miscommunication  Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to Well, they haven't even arrested him yet  Come on, let's go Ah, no , I don't think Why We don't need a bunch of people staring at Who is Oh, they're staring  They know we're on a date  They're making fun  Come on  It's Hello  No she's not here  Yes I will tell her  No I don't

thing  I think I would like to play with dolls  What's so Ha  So, George, I was talking to Elaine A ha  We're just Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of Oh, Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to Well, she probably just Um, did      uh,       wait a second  Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from That's what I'm       WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD  AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - George, all I did was hand someone a It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace No, no no I didn't know  I, I'm I went all the way down to the warehouse  It took me three hours  I had a big fight with the Really  A fight with the Well, again, I'm just awfully Yeah  Well, then how about going out with me I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day  Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee  The circumstantial evidence is You had how many dates with him  Around three  I don't And   I told you  He stopped calling me  I moved on  I'm not hung up on him  What are you looking What  I'm not looking  Why are you looking at my Where am I going to Kiss       I All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was  Newman found this Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store You're going out with the stationery store I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE  You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad  Didn't Uh, You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything  But you had to have the BIG Hello, what  You're kidding  I'm turning it on  Oh, my god  Get out of here  Hey listen to this  They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest  He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey As you can see white Bronco  The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate  And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle  His name is  Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing 9-1-1 What are you Yeah, this is Kramer  I got Genderson in the car  He wants to see his fish  I'm taking him to see his fish  So tell the police to back Okay, sir, and what's your My name is Kramer  You know who I am I told you not to take the I thought we would blend If we took the palisades this never have we would have had all that bridge Ah, just Jail doesn't really seem like that great of revenge  Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying  Constantly calling him, hanging up when he answers the phone  Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long  After a while he would go, ""I wish that guy would kill me already, I can't take it anymore "" And how come when the police catch some really bad criminal or something they put him in the handcuffs, they hit him with the baton, they put the choke hold on him, then they're always careful they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the back of the patrol car  ""Watch your head, watch your head  Don't hit that metal edge there        That REALLY THE"

building  I just met this guy the other A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George   She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first  She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while
